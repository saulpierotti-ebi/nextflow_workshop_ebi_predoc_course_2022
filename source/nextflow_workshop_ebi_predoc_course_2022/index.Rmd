# Introduction to the workshop {-}

This workshop aims at introducing you to the world of workflow managers, in particular the workflow manager Nextflow.
This workshop was written as a practical for the EMBL-EBI predoc course, 2022 cohort.
I hope that you will find it useful, and in any case I would be happy to hear your feedback on it.
You can contact me at [saul@ebi.ac.uk](mailto:saul@ebi.ac.uk).

The workshop is written with an increasing level of difficulty, so feel free to skip what is too easy for you or stop when things become too complex.
